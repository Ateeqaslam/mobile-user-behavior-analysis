# Mobile User Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes mobile user interactions to identify key insights, such as usage patterns, retention rates, and engagement metrics. By using real-world data, it demonstrates how effective data analysis can help improve user experience and optimize app performance.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Clean and explore the dataset to uncover trends and patterns in user behavior.
- **Retention Analysis:** Investigate user retention and factors contributing to churn.
- **User Engagement Metrics:** Analyze user engagement and activity with visual insights.
- **Data Visualizations:** Graphs and charts to make analysis more interpretable.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data analysis
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Google Colab Notebook** for exploratory analysis

## Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset), containing anonymized data of mobile app users, capturing various aspects of their app usage and behavior.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mobile-user-behavior-analysis.git

2. Install required Python packages:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and explore the analysis/Step not needed in case of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [kaggle NoteBook](https://www.kaggle.com/code):
    ```bash
   jupyter notebook Mobile_Users_Behavior_.ipynb
